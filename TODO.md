### Tasks

- [x] Set up project GitHub repo with standard Python project structure
  - [x] Created Poetry-based Python project structure
  - [x] Added comprehensive README.md
  - [x] Added Makefile for common development tasks
  - [x] Set up development environment with Poetry
- [x] Download ASL Hands dataset (or write script to extract landmarks)
- [x] Create Python pipeline to:
  - [x] Load raw keypoints
  - [x] Label samples by hand signal
  - [x] Normalize and augment data (optional)
- [x] Split dataset into train/val/test splits (see Task 6)
- [x] Commit preprocessing pipeline and dataset loader

## 4. Determine Hand Signals to Use

### Tasks

- [ ] TBD

---

## 5. Draft a Model Recognizing Hand Signals

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement a basic pipeline:
  - [ ] Use MediaPipe to extract 21 hand landmarks (x,y,z)
  - [ ] Build classifier on top of flattened keypoint vectors
  - [ ] Start with simple MLP
- [ ] Implement MobileNetV2 or EfficientNet classifier (on keypoints or image patches)
- [ ] Train baseline model
- [ ] Log metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1

---

## 6. Split Dataset and Document Results

### Tasks

- [x] Ensure representative stratified splits (train / val / test)
  - [ ] Validate across participants if custom dataset is collected
- [ ] Document class balance and preprocessing steps
- [ ] Write data section of milestone report

---

## 7. Get Code Detecting Hand Signals via Live Video

### Tasks

- [ ] Use MediaPipe in real-time video capture (OpenCV)
- [ ] Integrate trained model inference
  - [ ] Real-time prediction with visualization (overlay gesture label on screen)
- [ ] Measure latency and FPS
- [ ] Write scripts to demo prediction pipeline
- [ ] (Optional) Export to TensorFlow Lite

---

## Evaluation & Reporting

### Quantitative

- [ ] Confusion matrix
- [ ] Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Notes

- Cite all third-party code, including MediaPipe and MobileNet sources
- Update this file weekly with progress (or move to `docs/` directory with changelog)
- The data split logic is now reusable and tested in `src/mp_drone_control/data/preprocess.py`.
